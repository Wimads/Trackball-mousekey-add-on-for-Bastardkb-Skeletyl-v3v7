# Trackball-mousekey-add-on-for-Bastardkb-Skeletyl-v3v7

This is a trackball and mousekey add-on for the Bastardkb Skeletyl.
The add-on is designed around the following components:
* Unmodified Skeletyl_v3v7 case (compatibility with earlier or newer versions has not been tested, but should be easily adaptable).
* Tindie PWM3360 sensor pcb (for its compact size as compared to the charybdis sensor pcb)
* Same roller bearings as Charybdis (MR63-3x6x2.5mm)

**!! This project is still in development, current status:**
* 3D files (stl) have been uploaded, looking for someone to print them.
* Tindie sensor has been received and will be wired up soon.
* Firmware has not been developed yet. I intend to adapt the charybdis firmware.

**How is this different from a Charybdis?**
1. This is meant to be an add-on for an existing skeletyl build (ie, you already built a skeletyl, and decided you want a trackball as well). It doesn't require a modified case, so you don't have to build an entirely new board and trash your skeletyl. You can simply add it to your existing skeletyl.
2. The ball position is slightly different, and intended to be used by your middle finger/ring finger, instead of the thumb.
3. It doesn't sacrifice a thumb key on the trackball side.
4. For the other keyboard half there is an add-on for 2 mouse keys, so you don't have to mess around with layers to use the mouse.
