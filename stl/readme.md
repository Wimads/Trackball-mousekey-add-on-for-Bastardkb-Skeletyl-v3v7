**notes on stl files**

These files were designed to be printed using MJF. SLS should also work.
If you want to print in FDM, I recommend removing the cutouts for the rubber bumpers on the bottom of the plates, since adding support may not be a very convenient solution here.
To edit these files, I recommend using the source file in OnShape:

There is 3 options for the trackball bearings, which require different files to print for the trackball holder:
1. For roller bearings (MR63-3x6x2.5mm), print trackball-holder_v221027
2. For BTU bearings (Veichu VCN310, 7.5mm), print trackball-holder-v2_v221116
3. For static ceramic bearings (3mm ZrO2 or Si3N4 balls), print trackball-holder-v2_v221116 and 3x static-bearing-holder_v221117
